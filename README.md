Weatherstation
==============

JavaFX Application that displays weather data recorded with my Raspberry Pi.
The Raspberry Pi is connected to a TV and the FX UI is controlled via the TV's remote control directly via CEC commands.

So no additional remotes etc are needed to toggle the diagram.

The configuration of the according RaspberryPis can be found in [another Repo](https://github.com/locked-fg/raspberry-weatherstation).
